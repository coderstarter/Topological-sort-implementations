# Topological-sort-implementations

Time Complexity: O(V+E). The above algorithm is simply DFS with an extra stack. So time complexity is the same as DFS
Auxiliary space: O(V). The extra space is needed for the stack

Applications of Topological Sorting:
Topological Sorting is mainly used for scheduling jobs from the given dependencies among jobs. 
In computer science, applications of this type arise in:
Instruction scheduling
Ordering of formula cell evaluation when recomputing formula values in spreadsheets
Logic synthesis
Determining the order of compilation tasks to perform in make files
Data serialization
Resolving symbol dependencies in linkers
